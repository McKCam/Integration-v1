# Integration-v1
The first iteration of the integral calculator implementation using C++. <br />

It is a console program that asks the user to input two numbers for a single polynomial function. Below is a screenshot of a sample test case. <br />

Tradeoffs: <br />
-Lack of edge case checking (i.e. does not check for non-number input)  <br />
-Only allows one function that was already pre-chosen by the designer, no opportunity for user to choose their own.  <br />
-A console program alone does not give the full picture of what is happening. How much of the area is negative? How much is positive?  <br />

Questions for the next iteration:  <br />
-How can I visualize this mathematical concept? What graphics libraries are out there? Would I stay in C++ or another language?  <br />
-If this program can work for any valid math function, how can we scale it to allow for more math functions?  <br />
